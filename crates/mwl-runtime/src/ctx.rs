//! The per-request context: the first argument of every compiled function and
//! every helper.
//!
//! `Ctx` is where everything that is "ambient" to running MWL code lives,
//! because [ADR 0012](../../../docs/adr/0012-no-superglobals.md) means nothing
//! is ambient to the *language*: no variable is host-populated, so the host's
//! state has to travel somewhere, and it travels here.
//!
//! # Layout is part of the ABI
//!
//! The two hot words come first, in a `#[repr(C)]` struct, because compiled
//! code loads them inline rather than calling anything:
//!
//! * [`SAFEPOINT_OFFSET`] — the safepoint poll `mwl-codegen` emits at every
//!   function entry and loop back edge (`docs/adr/README.md`'s project-start
//!   decisions). Load, test, predicted-not-taken branch to the
//!   [`mwl_safepoint`] slow path.
//! * [`DEBUG_FLAGS_OFFSET`] — [ADR 0018](../../../docs/adr/0018-coverage-tracing-and-profiling-as-safepoint-shaped-probes.md)
//!   § 1's probe check, at every statement boundary and every call site. Same
//!   shape, same cost class, and present in every compiled unit whether or not
//!   any request ever sets a bit — that is what makes coverage and tracing
//!   start/stoppable *mid-request*, which the rejected instrumented-tier
//!   design could not do.
//!
//! Both are exposed as `offset_of!` constants rather than restated numbers, so
//! adding a field can never silently desynchronise codegen from this struct.
//!
//! # Output
//!
//! `Ctx` owns where `echo` writes, rather than the runtime writing to the
//! process's stdout directly. Two reasons, in `CLAUDE.md`'s priority order:
//! under `mwl serve` a request's output is its HTTP response body, not a
//! process-wide stream (priority 1, request isolation); and a test can assert
//! on [`OutputSink::Buffer`] without capturing the process's real stdout
//! (priority 4).

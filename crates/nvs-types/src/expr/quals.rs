//! ADR 0024's `tainted` and ADR 0033's `secret`: one representation, two
//! independent axes, and the sinks that refuse them.
//!
//! The two are implemented together because they share one representation
//! ([`Ty::TaintedString`]/[`Ty::SecretString`]/[`Ty::SecretTaintedString`]/
//! etc. — one atom per combination) and one set of helpers
//! ([`is_tainted`]/[`is_secret`]/[`qualifiable_base`]/[`qualified_scalar`]).
//! Concatenation and interpolation poison their result on each axis
//! independently, exactly like ADR 0007's `mixed`-arithmetic precedent.
//! [`apply_qualifier_conversion_rule`] is the conversion half: a checked
//! conversion to `uint`/`int`/`float`/`bool`/an enum's backing type launders
//! both qualifiers for free, since none of those targets carry either to begin
//! with (a known, ADR-accepted gap for `secret`: unlike `tainted`,
//! "shape-proof implies safe" doesn't actually transfer — see ADR 0033 § 2's
//! own *Alternatives rejected*), while `bytes`/`string` (including the
//! identity-shaped `tainted string as string`/`secret string as string`, which
//! would otherwise be a silent bypass) keep both qualifiers across either
//! direction, per ADR 0009 § 3. In [`super::assign`]'s relation a same-base
//! value widens freely on either bit — a trusted, non-secret value is always a
//! safe over-approximation of "may be tainted"/"may be secret," the same
//! direction `mixed` never gets — but never narrows through assignment.
//!
//! The M2-reachable sinks are three. [`reject_non_literal_markup_conversion`]
//! is ADR 0024 § 5's one M2-scoped rule: `as Core\Html\Markup` accepts only a
//! literal string token, `tainted` or not — the rest of § 5 (auto-escaping,
//! `Markup + Markup`) waits on `Core\Html` actually existing.
//! [`reject_secret_markup_conversion`] is ADR 0033 § 4's sibling, giving a
//! `secret` operand there its own specific diagnostic ahead of the generic one
//! (escaping doesn't restore confidentiality, so `secret` gets no auto-escape
//! carve-out even once one exists for `tainted`). And
//! [`reject_secret_throwable_message`] is a `Throwable`-shaped class's
//! constructor message argument — see [`is_throwable_shaped`] for how that is
//! decided without a declared `Throwable`/`Exception`/`Error` stdlib to check
//! against.
//!
//! Part of [`super`]'s one expression checker, split across this directory so
//! a session editing one rule does not carry the rest in context. Every item
//! moved here unchanged; an item is `pub(super)` where it reaches across these
//! modules, which is the reach it had when `expr` was a single file.

//! `rule:security/optional-capability-degrades`
//! 's `Core\Cap::has`, and the one thing about it that is decided while
//! compiling: the name it asks about has to be a capability.
//!
//! The member itself runs — it reads the request's own grant table, which is
//! not known here — so unlike [`crate::retrieval`] and [`crate::program`] this
//! pass replaces nothing and records nothing. It is a refusal and no more.
//!
//! # Why a misspelling cannot be left to run time
//!
//! `has` answers a `bool`, and a name outside § 8's roster answers `false` —
//! the only safe answer, since nothing grants a capability that does not exist.
//! But *not granted* is what a correct spelling answers too, on every
//! deployment that did not grant it. So `Core\Cap::has("fs.delete")` is a
//! branch that never runs, on every machine, and there is no state anywhere at
//! run time from which the two could be told apart. That is exactly `E0798`'s
//! argument for checking a written `$member` at an attribute retrieval, and it
//! applies here for the same reason: the wrong answer and the right one are the
//! same value.
//!
//! Only a **written** name is refused. `rule:expressions/intrinsic-constant-arguments`'s rule — nothing is refused
//! for being dynamic — leaves a computed argument to run time, where
//! `nvs_stdlib::cap`'s helper answers `false` for it.
//!
//! # Both spellings come from `nvs-stdlib`
//!
//! Which member this is, and which names are capabilities, are
//! [`nvs_stdlib::cap::is_query`] and [`nvs_stdlib::cap::is_capability`]. The
//! latter reads `nvs_config::capability::Cap` — the same roster a `[grants]`
//! line is read against — so a capability added there is one this refusal
//! accepts in the same edit, and the checker holds no copy of a name. That
//! matters more than usual here: a stale copy would refuse a capability the
//! configuration grants, which is a compile error nobody can work around.

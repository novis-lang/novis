//! The IR's own value-representation type lattice — deliberately smaller and
//! flatter than `mwl_types::ty::Ty`, and not the same type.
//!
//! The checker's `Ty` exists to make `is_assignable` reject the *wrong*
//! program: it carries qualifiers (`tainted`, `secret`), full nominal class
//! identity, shape structure, and canonicalized unions — everything ADR 0007's
//! grammar promises a developer. None of that survives past `check_program`:
//! by the time a function reaches this crate it has already been proven to
//! type-check, so lowering only needs to know how a value is *represented*
//! for codegen — which native width and instruction it needs, not which
//! source-level type produced it. (An analogous split exists in most
//! compilers with a rich front-end type system and a small backend one — e.g.
//! Rust's `ty::Ty` versus a codegen backend's handful of scalar/ABI kinds.)
//!
//! # Known gaps
//!
//! Scoped to exactly what the first lowered slice (straight-line scalar
//! arithmetic and `return`) needs — see the crate's own module docs for the
//! full list. Not modeled yet, deliberately: `string`/`bytes` (need a runtime
//! representation and a refcounting decision first), `array<T>`, any
//! class/object type, and `void`/`never` outside return position. Widening
//! lowering past straight-line scalar code adds variants to this enum; it
//! does not replace the "erase checker qualifiers" design itself.

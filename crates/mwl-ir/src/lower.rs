//! Lowers one already-checked method body to a [`crate::ir::Function`] — see
//! the crate's own module docs for exactly which statement/expression shapes
//! this slice covers, and why it trusts its input rather than re-checking it.
//!
//! # Control flow (`if`/`while`)
//!
//! [`Lowering`] builds a function's basic blocks incrementally: at any point
//! there is exactly one "current" block still open (not yet given a
//! [`Terminator`]), threaded through the recursive lowering calls as
//! `cur: &mut BlockId`. Lowering a plain statement appends to that block;
//! lowering `if`/`while` seals it with a [`Terminator::Branch`] and hands
//! back a new current block — the merge point (`if`) or the loop's exit
//! (`while`) — for whatever comes next. Every block created along the way is
//! guaranteed to eventually get sealed: either by a `return` inside it, by an
//! explicit `Jump` back to a merge/loop point once its own statements are
//! lowered, or, for the one block still open when the whole method body is
//! done, by [`lower_method`]'s own fallback `return;`.
//!
//! `if`'s join and `while`'s loop-header join are each a single, hand-rolled
//! two-predecessor (or, for a loop header, pre-loop/back-edge) SSA merge —
//! not a general dominance-based phi-placement algorithm, since a structured
//! `if`/`while` only ever has that one shape of join point. A local that
//! keeps the same [`ValueId`] on every incoming edge needs no phi at all
//! (SSA value numbering falls out for free, same as the straight-line
//! slice); one that differs gets a fresh [`crate::ir::InstKind::Phi`] in the
//! join block. Only a local already bound *before* the `if`/`while` can ever
//! need a phi — a name that is missing from some incoming environment (e.g.
//! declared only inside one branch) never reaches the merge, because
//! `mwl_types::check_program` already required it to be definitely assigned
//! on every path before this slice's input is trusted; using it after would
//! already have been rejected there.
//!
//! A `while` loop's header phis are seeded before the body is lowered (their
//! back-edge incoming value isn't known yet) and patched afterwards once the
//! body's exit environment is known — see [`Lowering::lower_while`]. Which
//! locals need a header phi at all is decided by a syntactic pre-scan
//! ([`Lowering::collect_reassigned_locals`]), not a second type-check: it
//! only has to be a safe *over-approximation* of "might be reassigned",
//! since a spurious phi is merely redundant, never wrong.
//!
//! [`Lowering::emit_safepoint`] reserves an inert [`crate::ir::InstKind::Safepoint`]
//! at function entry ([`lower_method`]) and on a `while`'s actual back edge
//! (the last thing appended to the body block before it jumps to the
//! header) — see that variant's own doc comment for why only the shape is
//! reserved this session.

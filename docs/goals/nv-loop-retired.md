# The nv loop driver is gone, and looper runs the loop alone

## Why

### The target

Goal `looper-cutover` moved every goal, both side goals and the playbook into looper's format, and the
old driver's handover started looper's loop. The old driver's code, its goal data and every reader of
that data are still in the tree. This goal deletes them, so looper is the only loop this repository has.
The runbook it followed is deleted, and `git log` holds it.

## Standing decisions

- **Nothing of the loop is lost.** A reader of the old data is re-pointed at looper's goal files, or
  deleted together with what it serves. A gap is closed by a general looper feature, never by a fork or
  a Novis-only field.
- **`.claude/settings.json` is not edited by a session.** The handover wrote what looper needs. The
  entries the runbook's § 4 says it loses are listed in this goal's handoff for the user.
- **The side worktrees under `.agent-tmp/worktrees/side/` are never touched**, nor their branches or
  their `.loop/`.
- **The prompts.** `[prompts]` stays unset, so looper's built-in prompts run. AGENTS.md holds every rule
  a looper session needs before the prompts are deleted.
- **`coordinator.md`, `loop-authoring.md` and the head of `playbook.md`** are rewritten to point at
  looper. Only text about the old driver itself is deleted.

## Stages

### 1. the first session under looper is the proof

The runbook's § 7 steps 2 and 3. The first session under looper commits its wrap, and its status line is
read. A sweep or an orient that fails is fixed here first. This stage's check is `looper doctor`, which
passes once the handover has written the `looper guard` hook.

`looper.toml`'s `[sync] skip` lists `.claude/settings.json`, because goal `looper-cutover`'s `looper lint`
check had to pass before the handover wrote looper's entries there. That line is deleted here, and
`looper lint` then compares the file again.

### 2. the readers

Every reader of `data/chain.json`, `data/goals/` and `data/playbook/` that the runbook's § 5 names is
re-pointed at looper's goal files, or deleted with what it serves. That includes `lib/chain.ts`,
`bun nv plan --check`, `bun nv render --check`, `bun nv check`'s four schemas, `cmd/affected.ts`'s
session base and `cmd/guard.ts`'s goal rules. CI's `chain --check` and `playbook --check` lines go,
because CI has no looper.

### 3. the deletes

The runbook's § 7: `tools/nv/driver/`, the seven loop commands, their `main.ts` entries and tests,
`renderers/goal-plan.ts` and `docs/agent/goal-plan.md`, `data/goals/`, `data/playbook/`,
`docs/agent/goals/`, and the prompts once AGENTS.md holds their rules. `lib/written.ts` stops writing
`NOVIS_LOOP_WRITES`, and the old driver's files under `.loop/` are deleted. Looper's own files there
stay.

The playbook bullets under `docs/agent/playbook/` still end on nv's `[until: <kind> <arg>]` trailer,
because the old driver reads only that form. Each one becomes looper's `` `until: <kind> <arg>` ``
trailer here, when nv's reader in `tools/nv/lib/playbook-fragments.ts` is deleted with the commands
that use it. Looper has no `rule` kind. A `rule <topic>/<slug>` trailer becomes
`exists docs/rules/<topic>/<slug>.md`, which holds when the same file exists.

### 4. the docs

`docs/agent/coordinator.md`, `loop-authoring.md` and the head of `playbook.md` are rewritten to point at
looper. Only text about the old driver itself is deleted. Then `docs/agent/looper-cutover.md` is
deleted, `bun nv links` is green, and so are `bun nv verify` and `looper lint`.

## Handoff

### State

**All four stages are done, and the goal is reached.** `bun nv verify`, `bun nv verify --doc`,
`bun nv links`, `looper lint` and `looper doctor` are green on this tree, the driver-import grep finds
nothing, and `bun nv owners --closes nv-loop-retired` names no gap.

- Landed: no crate comment, test message or outstanding-members file cites `docs/agent/goals/` or
  `data/goals/`. A citation of a deleted goal is restated or dropped; a pointer to goal records now
  reads "a goal file under `docs/goals/`".
- `rule:tooling/the-chain-names-its-live-goal` describes looper's chain in `docs/goals/README.md`,
  and its record no longer guards with deleted files.
- The two `nvs-stdlib` Redis lease tests failed under the gate's load: a one-second lease expired
  between two calls. They now take a thirty-second lease for the refusal half and a three-second
  one for the renewal (`crates/nvs-stdlib/src/cache/redis.rs:1347`).

**For the user: `.claude/settings.json` holds allow entries for deleted commands.** Its `bun nv`
entries for `chain`, `goal`, `loop`, `loop-stats`, `orient`, `playbook` and `session` name commands
that no longer exist. No session edits that file, so removing them is the user's change.

### Next

Nothing in this goal. The next goal on the chain is `decision-records-retired`;
`docs/goals/decision-records-retired.md:542` quotes line spans of `loop-authoring.md` and
`commands.md` that this goal moved, so its first session re-derives them with a grep.

### Backlog

- Playbook bullets whose `until` names a deleted file, such as `tools/nv/cmd/orient.ts`:
  `looper playbook retire` deletes them (`docs/agent/playbook.md`).
- `bun nv rules --render` reports rule citations in later goals' files whose rules do not exist yet;
  each goal writes its own (`docs/goals/pdf.md:134`).
